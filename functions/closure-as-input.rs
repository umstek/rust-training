    QUOTE
    When taking a closure as an input parameter, the closure's complete type must be 
    annotated using one of a few traits. In order of decreasing restriction, they are:

    Fn: the closure captures by reference (&T)
    FnMut: the closure captures by mutable reference (&mut T)
    FnOnce: the closure captures by value (T)
    END QUOTE

    Restrictive in the point of view from inside of the closure. 
    If you use Fn, you can only read. If you use FnMut, you can also write. 
    If you use FnOnce, you control the lifetime of the variable(?).

// A function which takes a closure as an argument and calls it.
// <F> denotes that F is a "Generic type parameter"

    // The closure takes no input and returns nothing.

    // ^ TODO: Try changing this to `Fn` or `FnMut`.

// Syntax is strange.
